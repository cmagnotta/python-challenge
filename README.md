# python-challenge

In this challenge, I attempted to analyze financial data for a company, determining the difference in loss and profit over each month for several years worth of data.
I also used Python to find the winner of an election.
In pybank, I tried several approaches that did not work. I tried a for loop. But it didn't work. I was not getting the difference for each month.
Then I tried to define a function because I thought that would work, but I couldn't make that work, either.
After consulting with my tutor, I found that a nested for loop would be the best approach.

In pypoll after a few tries where I got an error about the file not being subscriptable, I turned it into a list.

I was not able to complete this assignment before the deadline, but I will continue to work on it.
